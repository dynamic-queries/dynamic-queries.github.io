This work is a re-creation of a method for learning the Hamiltonian of a dynamical system from [Bertlan and Dietrich](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article/29/12/121107/1027304/On-learning-Hamiltonian-systems-from-data). The article also introduces the fundamentals of Gaussian processes .

*All figures, equations, examples and code are a work of my own. Only the idea has been borrowed from the paper.*
