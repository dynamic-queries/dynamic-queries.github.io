## Introduction
Differential Equations are used as modeling tools in several scientific disciplines. Since the advent of affordable computing technologies, a prevalent theme in these fields is to numerically approximate the solutions to these differential equations using numerical integration. 

Consider a first order differential equation, formulated as an initial value problem. 

$$
\begin{align}
\label{eq:IVP}
\frac{d}{dx}y(x) = f(y(x),x) \\
y(x=0) = y_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n
\end{align}
$$

The central theme of numerical integration is to transform the solution of the IVP in (\ref{eq:IVP}) to the solution of the following quadrature problem.

$$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quad}
    y(x) = y_0 + \int_{x_0}^{x} dz\:f(z) = y_0 + \frac{1}{x-x_0} \int_{0}^{1} dq\:f(q) 
\end{equation}
$$

Admittedly, there are several techniques to approximate the integral in (\ref{eq:quad}). Here we are interested in a class of integrators that are suitable for stiff differential equations.

## Stiff Differential Equations
Stiffness of differential equations is an ambiguous term. Hairer and Wanner famouosly write about stiff differential equations, *as equations where evaluation of solutions using explicit integration methods is too inefficient*. There have been other attempts to formalize this "definition" using the eigenfunctions of the differential operator. Intuitively, stiff differential equations are those with $$f(y(x),x)$$ evolving in disparate scales along its different bases directions. 

## Exponential Integrators
The question of resolving the disparate timescales in $$f(y(x),x)$$ is addressed in exponential integrators as follows.

$$
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:exp-int}
    \frac{d}{dx}y(x) = Ay(x) + g(y(x),x) \textrm{  [Linearization] }
\end{align}
$$

The solution to the homogenous problem in (\ref{eq:exp-int}), is 

$$
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:exact-sol}
    y(x) = \exp^{xA} y(0)
\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:exp}
    \exp^{zA} = \mathcal{I} + \frac{zA}{1!} + \frac{(zA)^2}{2!} + \frac{(zA)^3}{3!} + ...
\end{equation}
$$

For a generic heterogenity, $$g(x)$$, the solution is expressed in terms of its propagator.

$$
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hetero}
    y(x) = \exp^{xA} y(0) + \int dz \: \exp^{(x-z)A} g(y(z),z)
\end{equation}
$$
