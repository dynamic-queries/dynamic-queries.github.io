I am a masters student and a student-researcher at the Technical University of Munich.

I am an active proponent of 
[John Tukey](https://nationalmedals.org/laureate/john-wilder-tukey/)'s -- "getting to play in everyoneâ€™s backyard" idea. 

Promptly, I am interested in all things [manifold learning](https://fdresearchblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/informal-introduction-to-manifold-learning.pdf) and its applications to Many Body Physics, Non-linear Model Order Reduction and other surrogates for large scale dynamical systems.

My research focuses on developing novel numerical and statistical methods for a litany of applications, among other things, computational fluid dynamics, quantum many body physics, waveform inversion and quantum chemistry.


I also founded the [SIAM Student Chapter](https://siam-munich-chapter.github.io/SIAM_Munich.io/) at the Technical University of Munich in 2023.
