I am a masters student and a student-researcher at the Technical University of Munich. I am an active proponent of 
[John Tukey](https://nationalmedals.org/laureate/john-wilder-tukey/)'s -- "getting to play in everyoneâ€™s backyard" idea. Promptly, I am interested in all things [manifold learning](https://fdresearchblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/informal-introduction-to-manifold-learning.pdf) and its applications to Many Body Physics, Non-linear Model Order Reduction and other surrogates for large scale dynamical systems.

I am particularly intrigued by the duality of optimization landscapes and evolution potentials of large scale (especially quantum) dynamical systems. Also, waves are fun!!

My research focuses on developing novel numerical and statistical methods for dynamical systems with applications spanning computational fluid dynamics, quantum many body physics, waveform inversion and quantum chemistry.


I also founded the [SIAM Student Chapter](https://siam-munich-chapter.github.io/SIAM_Munich.io/) at the Technical University of Munich in 2023.
